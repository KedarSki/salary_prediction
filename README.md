Overview
This project is designed to help with basic Machine Learning workflows in Python using Poetry for dependency management and pytest for testing. The goal of this project is to predict if a job's salary is above the median using a simple ML model. The project includes tasks such as data processing, model building, and deploying a basic FastAPI service, all packaged in a Docker container.

🏆 Key Deliverables

🧹 Data Processing Pipeline: A well-defined pipeline for cleaning and preparing the data.

🧠 Machine Learning Model: A trained and evaluated ML model.

🔌 FastAPI Application: A RESTful service for salary prediction.

🐳 Dockerized Application: A Docker container that can be deployed locally or on a cloud platform.

🧪 Unit Tests: Tests covering data processing, prediction logic, and API.

How to Get Started:

Requirements:

Python >= 3.8
Poetry >= 1.2
Docker (optional for containerized deployment)

Setup:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/salary_prediction.git
cd salary_prediction

Install Dependencies: Use Poetry to manage dependencies:
make poetry-download
make poetry-install-deps

Activate the Environment: Activate the virtual environment (manual method not included here)
poetry shell

Run Tests: Execute all tests to ensure everything works as expected.
make check-all

Run the Application: Start the FastAPI service locally.
poetry run uvicorn src.main:app --reload

Docker Deployment (Optional): Build and run the containerized application.
docker build -t salary-prediction .
docker run -p 8000:8000 salary-prediction

Makefile Guide
The Makefile automates common tasks, such as:

Dependency installation (make poetry-install-deps)
Running tests (make check-all)
Running linters like black, pylint, and mypy.
